# Accessing Bokuâ€™s Test Environment via Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) is a developer tool that allows for convenient API testing.

With our Postman collection, developers can quickly test Boku API's without having to worry about the intricacies of [Boku API Authentication](https://github.com/boku-inc/boku-api-docs/blob/main/boku-api-auth/README.md).

1. Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Download the Boku [Merchant Test Environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boku-inc/boku-api-docs/main/common/postman/Merchant%20Test%20Environment.postman_environment.json) Postman environment
3. Download the [Payment Gateway (LPM)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boku-inc/boku-api-docs/main/boku-direct-lpm/postman/Payment%20Gateway%20(LPM).postman_collection.json) Postman collection
4. Within the Postman application, import `Merchant Test Environment.postman_environment.json` and `Payment Gateway (LPM).postman_collection.json`
